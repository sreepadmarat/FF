The 96th Academy Awards ceremony, which was presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), and took place on March 10, 2024, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles.[3] During the show, the AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories honoring films released in 2023. Comedian Jimmy Kimmel hosted the show for the fourth time, following the 89th ceremony in 2017, the 90th ceremony in 2018, and the 95th ceremony in 2023.[4]

The nominations were announced on January 23, 2024. Oppenheimer led with 13 nominations, followed by Poor Things and Killers of the Flower Moon with 11 and 10, respectively.[5][6][7] Oppenheimer won a leading seven awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.[8] Other major winners were Poor Things with four awards and The Zone of Interest with two. The films which went home with one award each include American Fiction, Anatomy of a Fall, Barbie, The Boy and the Heron, Godzilla Minus One, The Holdovers, and 20 Days in Mariupol. The telecast drew 19.5 million viewers in the United States, becoming the most watched awards show since 2020.[9]

In related events, the Academy held its 14th annual Governors Awards ceremony, hosted by John Mulaney, at the Ray Dolby Ballroom at Ovation Hollywood on January 9, 2024.[10] The Academy Scientific and Technical Awards were presented by host Natasha Lyonne on February 23, 2024, at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles.[11] An American Sign Language livestream was broadcast on the Academy's YouTube page featuring video of interpreters.[12]

Winners and nominees
The nominees for the 96th Academy Awards were announced on January 23, 2024, by actors Zazie Beetz and Jack Quaid at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills.[3][13][14] The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 10, 2024.[3]

The cultural phenomenon of "Barbenheimer" received a total of twenty-one nominations (eight for Barbie and thirteen for Oppenheimer). The two films competed against each other in six categories, including Best Picture.[6][15][16]

Several notable nominees include Steven Spielberg, who extended his record for the most Best Picture nominations to thirteen;[17] Martin Scorsese, who received his tenth nomination for Best Director, and became the oldest nominee in the category;[a][18] Thelma Schoonmaker, who received her ninth nomination for Best Film Editing;[20] composer John Williams, who received his 54th nomination;[21][22] and Willie D. Burton, who received his eighth nomination as a below-the-line crew member.[21][23][24]

Ten actors received their first Oscar nominations this year.[25] The acting nominees included portrayals from three openly LGBTQ+ actors: Colman Domingo, Jodie Foster, and Lily Gladstone.[26][27] Gladstone also became the first Native American actress to be nominated.[28][29] Scott George, who wrote the music and lyrics to "Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)", became the first member of the Osage Nation to be nominated for an Academy Award.[30]

This was the fifth consecutive year with at least one Best Picture nominee directed by a woman: Greta Gerwig with Barbie, Celine Song with Past Lives, and Justine Triet with Anatomy of a Fall.[31][32] Triet also became the eighth woman nominated for Best Director.[33][34] Overall, six couples received nominations that they shared together in their respective categories.[35]

Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell won Best Original Song, becoming the youngest two-time Oscar winners in history (22 and 26 years, respectively) after also winning it during the 94th Academy Awards.[36]

Killers of the Flower Moon became Scorsese's third film to be nominated in ten categories and not win a single award, after Gangs of New York and The Irishman.[37]

The Zone of Interest is the first non-English language British film to win for International Feature and Sound.[38]

Godzilla Minus One became the first ever Godzilla film to be nominated for an Academy Award, as well as the first Japanese[b], Asian, and overall second non-English language film to be nominated for (after All Quiet on the Western Front in 2023), and the first to win, the Best Visual Effects category.[43] In addition, Yamazaki became the first director since Stanley Kubrick (for 2001: A Space Odyssey in 1969),[c] and Kiyoko Shibuya became the first woman of color[47] in the category.

The Boy and the Heron is the second traditionally hand-drawn, second anime, and second non-English language animation to win Best Animated Feature, with director Hayao Miyazaki the first Asian director to win Best Animated Feature twice and, at the age of 83, the oldest director to win Best Animated Feature.[48] Additionally, The Boy and the Heron became the first PG-13 animated film to win Best Animated Feature; all of the previous winners are rated G or PG.[49]

Ceremony Information
Photo of Jimmy Kimmel in June 2022.
Jimmy Kimmel hosted the 96th Academy Awards, his fourth overall.
On October 17, 2023, Raj Kapoor and Katy Mullan were announced as executive producers, with Hamish Hamilton serving as director; Mullan is an executive of Hamilton's production company Done and Dusted.[61] On November 15, Jimmy Kimmel was announced as host, returning for the second consecutive year and fourth Academy Awards overall.[4] On the same day, his wife, Molly McNearney, was announced to return as executive producer for the ceremony.[4]

On November 30, 2023, ABC and the Academy announced that the start time of the ceremony would be moved up by an hour to 4:00 p.m. PT (7:00 p.m. ET).[62] This change enabled ABC to air a half-hour of primetime programming as a lead-out, featuring a new episode of its sitcom Abbott Elementary.[62] The pre-show was hosted for the third consecutive year by Vanessa Hudgens, joined by new co-host Julianne Hough.[63] Due to the scheduling change, the pre-show was shortened to 30 minutes.[62] The beginning of the ceremony was delayed by six minutes, due to arrivals being slowed by Israel–Hamas war protests outside of the theatre.[64][65][66]

On January 29, 2024, comedian and broadcaster Amelia Dimoldenberg, host of the YouTube interview series Chicken Shop Date, was announced as the social media ambassador and red carpet correspondent. Dimoldenberg was involved in multiple Oscar season events, including the Oscars Nominees luncheon, where she participated in an Academy video production with nominees. She was also involved with an "Oscars 96 Behind the Scenes Tour", in addition to interviewing nominees and other talent present at the Oscars red carpet.[67]

Presenters were announced in a series of groups beginning on February 26, 2024.[68][69][70] Performers were announced on February 28, 2024,[71] although Ryan Gosling's performance of "I'm Just Ken" from Barbie was reported by Variety two days earlier.[72] After the first batch of presenters was announced, The Hollywood Reporter learned that the Academy would revive a popular presenting format previously used during the 81st ceremony,[73] where five Oscar-winning actors for leading and supporting performances took the stage together to introduce the current nominees in their respective categories.[74] David Alan Grier was selected as the event's announcer.[75]

Production designers Alana Billingsley and Misty Buckley designed an "inviting, colorful, and intimate" stage over the course of nine months. According to Billingsley and Buckley, they were inspired by contemporary spaces where people can "meet, exchange, create. Like a modern-day plaza".[76] The stage utilized "soft plaster, warm whites, and tones that pull the whole design together".[76] Kapoor wanted the stage to feel "immersive and innovative, and then at times we also wanted it to feel intimate. I think when you walk into the theater and when you see it, it has this very warm and enveloping feel and the gestures feel soft. It is kind of like a hug, because of how the screens and [structures] have this lovely curve shape. That's how we want people to feel".[76] Throughout the ceremony, the stage subtly changed its design to honor the nominees; the screenplay categories included images of real typewriters, while the Best Costume Design category showcased images of several of the nominated costumes.[76]

Nominees Kaouther Ben Hania, Finneas O'Connell, Billie Eilish, and Mark Ruffalo wore red Artists4Ceasefire badges calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.[77][78][79][80]

Diversity rules
This was the first year that the diversity rules for the Best Picture category became mandatory. In June 2020, under its Academy Aperture 2025 initiative, the academy established a set of "representation and inclusion standards" that a film would be required to satisfy in order to compete in the category.[81] For the 94th and 95th Academy Awards (films released in 2021 and 2022), filmmakers were just required to submit a confidential "Academy Inclusion Standards" form for data purposes only.[82] There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) "on-screen representation, themes, and narratives"; (b) "creative leadership and project team"; (c) "industry access and opportunities"; and (d) "audience development".[81]

As explained by Alissa Wilkinson of Vox in 2020, the standards "basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment".[82] The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment for "underrepresented" racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with "cognitive or physical disabilities".[81]

Box office performance of Best Picture nominees
When the nominations were announced, the films nominated for Best Picture had earned a combined gross of $1.09 billion at the American and Canadian box offices at the time.[83] Barbie was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees, with $636 million in domestic box office receipts. Oppenheimer came in second with $327 million. The two films, comprising the Barbenheimer phenomenon, represented 88% of the cumulative box office haul generated by Best Picture nominees prior to their nominations.[84] Oppenheimer became the highest-grossing Best Picture winner since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King at the 76th Academy Awards in 2004. It also became the first one to gross more than $100 million at the domestic box office in the decade since Argo at the 85th Academy Awards in 2013.[85]

Israel–Hamas war
The ceremony was impacted in several ways by the ongoing Israel–Hamas war. Due to anti-war protesters who blocked the major traffic thoroughfares leading to the theatre, the ceremony began six minutes after its scheduled broadcast.[86][87] Several members of the Artists4Ceasefire collective, including Mark Ruffalo, Billie Eilish, Mahershala Ali, and Ramy Youssef, wore red handprint buttons to call for an end to the war in Gaza,[88][89] leading to condemnation from Israel supporters.[90] While The Zone of Interest director Jonathan Glazer was mostly praised for his Best International Feature acceptance speech during which he called for the end to Israel's attacks in Gaza,[91] he was criticized by pro-Israel and some Jewish figures[92][93] who claimed that he was "refuting his Jewishness", which uses a quote from his speech out of context.[94]

Reception
The ceremony received mostly positive reviews from the critics,[95] with musical performances of "I'm Just Ken" and "Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)", John Mulaney summarizing the plot of Field of Dreams while presenting the award for Best Sound, an almost nude John Cena presenting Best Costume Design (which Kimmel billed as marking the 50th anniversary of a streaking incident at the 1974 ceremony),[96][97] respective wins of Japanese films Godzilla Minus One and The Boy and the Heron,[98][99][100] and past acting winners introducing this year's nominees considered by many to be the highlights of the ceremony.[101][102][103]

Conversely, the In Memoriam section received criticism for being too distracting and the names and faces being so tiny and distant much of the time that it was difficult recognizing them.[104][105][106] Al Pacino, who was assigned to present the award for Best Picture at the end of the show, received criticism for not naming the 10 nominees before announcing the winner.[107][108] Instead, Pacino made a short statement, opened the envelope, then awkwardly announced that Oppenheimer was the Best Picture winner. The next day, Pacino revealed that the choice of omitting the names of the 10 nominees was made by the show producers and that he only "followed the Academy's script for the night".[109] Clips from the Best Picture nominees had been shown over the course of the ceremony, and producer Molly McNearney said to Variety that the reading of the nominees was cut "because we were very worried that the show was going to be long". The nominees for Best Original Song had also not been read aloud when that award was handed out, as each of the songs had been performed earlier in the evening.[110]

Ratings
The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 19.5 million people over its length, which was a 4% increase from the previous year's ceremony and marking the longest streak of annual ratings increases for the Academy Awards since 2014.[111] However, the show slipped a little in 18–49 demo rating with a 3.81 rating among viewers in that key demographic, down 5% from 4.03 rating of last year's ceremony.[112] The viewership peaked in the last half-hour with 21.9 million total viewers.[113] The ceremony scored the biggest audience for any awards show since the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020, and is so far the largest viewership for any live non-sports entertainment program on U.S. television in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era.[9] ABC's Abbott Elementary lead-out also benefitted, with the episode reaching a series high in the 18–49 demo (1.42 rating) and total viewership (6.9 million).[114][62]
